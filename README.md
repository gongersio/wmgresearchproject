This repository will contain all code relevant to my WMG Research Project.

The aim of the project is to investigate how VR content on TikTok can be used for educational purposes.

Videos with certain hashtags (e.g. #virtualreality) will be downloaded from TikTok and analysed for their relevant content. 

This will be done using a combination of text and video analysis pipelines which are implemented using dedicated Python libraries.

Here is a list of the required libraries required for the code to run (not inlcuding their dependencies):
* PixelLib
* TensorFlow
* OpenCV
* spaCy
* pydub
* speech_recognition

FFmpeg can be downloaded here: https://ffmpeg.org/download.html (required for pydub).

The training model for PixelLib can be downloaded here: https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN/releases/download/v2.0/mask_rcnn_coco.h5
